# Island Perimeter

## Description
This project focuses on calculating the perimeter of an island within a grid. The grid is represented as a 2D list of integers, where:
- `0` represents water.
- `1` represents land.

The goal is to determine the perimeter of the island formed by the land cells.

## Requirements
- Python 3.4.3
- No external modules can be imported.
- Code must follow PEP 8 style guidelines.

## Usage
To calculate the perimeter of the island, a function `island_perimeter(grid)` is implemented. The function takes a 2D list `grid` as input and returns the perimeter of the island.
